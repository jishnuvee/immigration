We are examining Georgia voters attitudes towards immigration. The data source being used is past survey results about immigration from a year ago or more and we attempt to examine how exposure to Spanish-speakers effects voter attitudes toward immigration? A potential weakness in our model is that we are examining voter attitudes toward immigration in Georgia today, but we are using data from a 2012 experiment with Boston commuters, but when in reality there are non-commuters in Georgia and the time period difference might have cause a difference in political ideologies for the state and people.

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon$$

with $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.
